                                Community leaders will have to install the Server Side Mod on their server, while players will need to install the clientside only.</br>
                                !!!The mod works without players installing the client-side mod, but some features may not work properly!!!</br>
                                !!!Be aware that the mod is only tested on WINDOWS-based hosts. While it likely works on linux-based hosts as well, I do not guaratee it, and you will have to compile the linux files yourself.!!!
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            This section will look at installing the mod, as well as go through some settings that I advise server owners to do.</br>
                            I will be using a host called Bluefang for this guide, so you must adapt the settings and commands to your own host should it be any different. </br>

                        <hr>

                        <h4>Server-Side.</h4>

                        <p>Firstly, make sure that you have the latest version of the mod downloaded from the online repository. If you are usure about which version you have, you can look in the .zip filename or you can go to the repository and download the latest version again.</p>

                        <a href="https://github.com/alexnita3/GalaxyRP/releases" class="btn btn-primary">All GalaxyRP Versions</a>

                        <p>After you have done that, make sure your server is turned off, and you have FTP access. Go into the server files, and look for the folder where all the executables are. You will know you've found the right one when the folder structure looks like this:</p>

                        <center><a href="images/upload/image1.PNG" data-rel="prettyPhoto"><img src="images/upload/image1.PNG" alt="" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></center>

                        <p>Unzip the Server-side files anywhere on your system, and open the folder that was generated. (It should be called ServerSide, or something similar.) Select all the mod files, as shown below, and transfer them to the server folder mentioned in the last step. If you're asked if you want to replace any files, click on yes for each oen of them.</p>

                        <center><a href="images/upload/image2.PNG" data-rel="prettyPhoto"><img src="images/upload/image2.PNG" alt="" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></center>

                        <p>
                            After the installation, go into your server control panel, and expand the "Command Line Editor" section, where you will find a few options that need changing.</br>
                            The first will be the 'Templates' section. Click on the dropdown list, and select the option called Active Command Line Parameters.
                            The second will be the 'Parameters' section. This is slightly trickier to modify. You will need to write down the IP address for the server, as well as the port. After you have those, you will need to paste the following command in the textbox, making sure to replace the ip address and port with your own:
                        </p>

                        <pre class="brush: html">
                            +set fs_game GalaxyRP +set dedicated 2 +set net_ip 000.000.00.00 +set net_port 17118 +exec server.cfg
                        </pre>

                        <p>Make sure you click Update Command Line Parameters afterward. Your setting shoudl now look like this:</p>

                        <center><a href="images/upload/bluefang.PNG" data-rel="prettyPhoto"><img src="images/upload/bluefang.PNG" alt="" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a></center>

                        <p>All you have to do now is start your server, and players can connect!</p>

                        <p>Sometimes, if you find that the mod isn't working correctly, particularly saving and loading accounts, you should go to the FTP file manager, and change the permissions to all files so that they can be read, written to and executed by everyone. (Don't worry, you will still need a password to acces the files.) This option can sometimes be found as 'chmod'. If it asks you to input a number, input 777</p>

                        <hr>

                        <h4>Client-Side.</h4>

                        <p>All you need to do is copy the Client side files into your GameData folder on your machine. After that, make sure you run openjk.x86.exe instead of jamp.exe.</p>

                                        All the commands are inputted via the game's console. To get to it, press "`" (The key above TAB). If that doesn't work, try pressing SHIFT + ` .</br>
                                        This is where you'll write all your commands. To do that, start typing and press enter to activate the command.</br>

                                        To start playing, you will need an account. This is where all your characters and admin permissions will be stored.</br>

                                        To create an account run the following command (Replace everything in "[" "]" with your own values, so "/new [user] [pass]" will mean that you have to enter for example "/new alex supersecretpassword").
                                    </p>

                                        If the account is what stores your character, your character is where all your skills, credits and items are stored. </br>
                                        An account can have multiple characters, all at completely different levels and skills.</br>
                                        To create your character, use:
                                    </p>

                                    <pre class="brush: html">

                                        My suggestion is to use the character's first name as the input. So a character named "Tia Luminara" should be named "Tia" in the console.

                            The account system allows a player to create an account in the server. It contains his admin commands, his settings,
                            and all roleplaying stuff.
                            </br>
                            When creating an account, a character will be created by default with the same name as the account. The player can create further characters that are associated with the same account, without having to create multiple accounts.

                                        With credits, the player can buy and sell stuff. To do that, he must call the jawa seller.
                                        By pressing the Use Key on him, he will talk to the player and say what commands to use.
                                        To buy or sell things, the player must be near the seller and use the appropriate commands.

                                        <h4>Upgrades</h4>
                                        
                                        Most of the stuff the seller sells are temporary ones. If the player dies, he loses them and must buy again.
                                        The upgrades are permanent stuff that will not be lost even if the player dies. 
                                        It is very important to buy them, because of the benefits they give.
                                        
                                        <h4>Giving Credits to other players</h4>
                                        
                                        A player can give credits to another RPG player. Credits can also be spent, essentially deleting them from the players account without them ending up in a different one.
                                        This can be used to create different roleplaying scenarios that involve NPCs.

                                    There are two types of emotes supported by the mod: worded and generic. </br>
                                    Worded emotes are easier to remember and are more common, they are defined by a word, instead of a number, while generic emotes are defined by an ID, between 0 and 1542.

                                    <h4>How to play</h4>

                                    First, an admin must place the arena in the map with /duelarena. After that, players can join the tournament with /duelmode.
                                    After some seconds, the tournament starts, and the server chooses the players which will duel now in the arena.

                                    <h4>Score and HP Score</h4>

                                    It has a championship format, so every player will have to fight every other player.
                                    Winning a duel (by defeating the enemy or time run out and the player has more hp than the enemy) gives 3 score.
                                    Losing gives 0.
                                    If it ends in a tie (if both players die at the same time or tie runs out with both players with same hp and shield), each player gets 1 score.
                                    Everytime a duel match ends, the score table is printed in console.
                                    After all matches are done, the player with the highest score wins, and receives a prize.
                                    If there is more than one player with the same score at the end of tournament, the untie criteria (HP Score) is used. It is the red number
                                    shown in /dueltable. Every time a player wins a duel, his remaining hp and shield is added to this number, so when players are tied in score,
                                    the player with highest red number will be ahead.

                                    <h4>Teams</h4>

                                    The Duel Tournament will allow players to add other players as allies, so it is possible to have 1v1, 2v1 and 2v2 matches.
                                    To add someone, after joining tournament with /duelmode, press Use key (usually R) on the player. He will have to do the same to establish the alliance.
                                    Matches are balanced by making the players in team have only hp and no shield during 2v1 and 2v2 matches.
